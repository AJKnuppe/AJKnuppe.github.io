I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at The Ohio State University. With concentrations in international relations and political methodology, my research interests include post-conflict statebuilding, militia politics, and the study of religion in international politics. My dissertation examines US security force assistance to the anti-ISIL coalition in Iraq, focusing on how noncombatants perceive of the legitimacy of foreign support to local security providers. Other work develops a typology of state building strategies used by great powers, as well as how non-state militias legitimize their activity in the eyes of the civilian population. My work has been supported by the U.S. Institute of Peace, the John Templeton Foundation, the Mershon Center for International Security Studies, and the Ohio State Decision Science Collaborative.  Prior to Ohio State, I was a Robert Bosch Fellows in Berlin working in policy planning at the German Federal Ministry of Defense and as a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. I also work as an outside instructor for the U.S. State Departmentâ€™s Foreign Service Institute. I have a MA (honors) from the Committee on International Relations at the University of Chicago and a BA (honors) from Calvin College.
